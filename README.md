# Data Science projects.
This repository contains some Data Science projects that I have worked on in my Masters in Data Science with University of New Haven (San Francisco campus).

## 1 - Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

This is an example of [combining machine learning with natural language processing](Machine%20Learning%20%26%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20-%20Economic%20News%20Articles.) with a set of economic news articles to predict whether they are relevant or not.

## 2 - Data Engineering.

Using the [MeetUp API, a pipeline in Amazon Web Services (AWS)](Data%20Engineering%20-%20Creating%20an%20AWS%20pipeline%20using%20MeetUp%20API.) was implemented using Spark. A relational database using PostgreSQL was also implemented using MeetUp data. AirFlow was also implemented to schedule jobs.

## 3 - Deep Learning.

Different convolutional neural network architectures were implemented to classify food images. Transfer learning using InceptionV3 was also implemented in Google Cloud. [The repository can be found here](https://github.com/carlespoles/DSCI6051-student).

## 4 - Dashboard for business metrics and KPIs and EDA.

During this internishp, I implemented a dashboard for different business metrics using Google Data Studio and Google Cloud Platform BigQuery. Also used Google Cloud Platform VM and Datalab. [The repository can be found here](https://github.com/carlespoles/DSCI6010-student).
