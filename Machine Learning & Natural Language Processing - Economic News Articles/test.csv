Sign up for the e-mail here.</br></br>On Friday evening, with Congress out of town on its summer recess and Americans heading into a mid-August weekend, the Bush administration sent a message to the states: The federal government will make it tougher for a national children's insurance program to cover the offspring of middle-income families.</br></br>The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in 1997 to help children whose families couldn't afford insurance but didn't qualify for Medicaid, and administration officials tell the New York Times that the changes are aimed at returning the program to its low- income focus and assuring it didn't become a replacement for private insurance. Administration point man Dennis Smith wrote to state officials saying there would be new restrictions on the District of Columbia and the 18 states -- including California and New York -- that extend or plan to extend coverage for children whose families make more than 250% of Federal poverty levels. For a family of three that 250% is $42,900, and for a family of four it's $51,625. Under the new limits, a child from a family making more would have to spend one year uninsured before qualifying, and any state that wants to extend coverage would have to assure Washington that at least 95% of children eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid are enrolled in one of the programs. But as the Associated Press reports, no state can currently make such assurances.</br></br>Rachel Klein, deputy director of health policy for advocacy group Families USA, tells the AP that since many families above the 250% threshold can't afford private insurance, ""the effect of this policy is to have more uninsured kids."" Ann Clemency Kohler, deputy commissioner of human services in New Jersey, tells the Times the changes ""will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children."" States have already been imposing waiting periods and taking other steps to prevent parents from moving their children from private insurance to SCHIP, which currently serves some 6.6 million children, the Washington Post notes. The administration's new restrictions come as the program, which expires at the end of next month if Congress doesn't reauthorize it, is the subject of a larger political fight that pits the White House against Democrats and some Republicans in Congress and state capitals."

The latest version of the House banking bill also drops the administration's proposals to broaden bank entry into the securities business.</br></br>Last night, the House began its second attempt to pass a banking bill after failing last week, in part because of disagreement over how to allow banks into the securities business. The House adopted on a voice vote provisions that would replenish the bank deposit insurance fund, tighten bank regulation, trim the scope of deposit insurance, and restrict the Federal Reserve Board's ability to keep sick banks alive with loans.</br></br>But the House delayed until today a vote on an amendment to allow banks to branch nationwide and on final passage of the banking bill to give the House leadership and the administration more time to drum up support for the bill.</br></br>House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) is working hard to win passage of the bill in the face of significant opposition from Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), who believes the bill should include provisions imposing stiffer regulation on banks in the securities business."
